I utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the Pandas library to analyze data of in-game purchases for a video game company. 
I aggregated and analyzed the data by gender, age, most profitable items purchased, and users who made the largest in-game purchases.
Most of the players were male and made up the largest number of purchases and had the highest purchase amount.
The age group 20-24 also made more in-game purchases than any other age group.
